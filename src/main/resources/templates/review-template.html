		<h2>Best IoT Platforms</h2>
		<img th:src="@{${reviewModel.imageUrl}}">
		<p1>With IoT platforms, developers can build applications specifically for IoT purposes. These platforms provide users with the ability to quickly build, test, deploy, and iterate on IoT-specific applications. Once built, businesses can connect these applications and continuously improve the solutions. IoT platforms often offer similar functionality to low or no-code development platforms, such as drag-and-drop elements and WYSIWYG editors for non-developers. However, most do require some level of coding knowledge, and the more sophisticated platforms may require highly skilled developers. In addition to their standard functionality, some cloud platform as a service products may offer the ability to build IoT enabled applications.</p1>
		<p1>To qualify for inclusion in the IoT Platforms category, a product must:</p1>
		<p1>Provide a platform for developers to build IoT-specific applications
			Offer application management tools for IoT specific application
			Possess the ability to deploy connected IoT application</p1>
